Coin Convert is a simple CLI application that converts currencies (written in rust btw). 

```
Usage: coin_convert <amount> <currency_from> <currency_to>

Converts an amount from one currency to another.

Arguments:
<amount>          The numerical value to be converted.
<currency_from>   The currency code to convert from.
<currency_to>     The currency code to convert to.

Example:
coin_convert 100 USD EUR

Note:
- Make sure to use valid currency codes.
- The conversion rates are based on the latest available data.
- A currency code is a 3 letter abbreviation defined in ISO 4217.
```

Note: This is just something I am using to learn rust so it is rather trivial and pointless.
